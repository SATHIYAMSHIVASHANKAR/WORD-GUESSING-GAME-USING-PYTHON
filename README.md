# WORD-GUESSING-GAME-USING-PYTHON
CREATION OF WORD GAME USING CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN PYTHON
***
import the Random library.
***
Create a variable that collects the users name.
***
Introduce a list of words under Words variable in which the user is intended to guess a word.
***
Now Random key word is used to select a random word.
***
Allocate the number of guesses to be made under a variable named Turns.
***  
Now initiallize the looping statement, which look into the number of times the user failed and the letter guesed by the user. This should be in the form of nested looping format.
***
Here conditional statement is been initallized, which ultimately compares the character in guesses with the randomly selected word.
***
Here an other conditional statement is been initallized, which ultimately looks for the worng guessed charector from the user.
***
Now the turns equals zero, the user is failed to find the word, hence it displayes as YOU LOOSE.
***
Now the failed equals zero, the user is acheived to find the word, hence it displayes as YOU WIN and the respective word will be displayed.
